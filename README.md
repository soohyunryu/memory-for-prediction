This repository is for reproducing results in Ryu & Lewis (*in prep*).

This repository includes code for generating psycholinguistic metrics, running models, and creating the plots presented in the paper. The raw and annotated data from naturalistic reading experiments cannot be uploaded to the repository due to their size but are available upon request.
